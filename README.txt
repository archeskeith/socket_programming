Name: Arches, Keith Nicole
Section: T4L
Exercise: 08 (Socket Programming)
Programming Language Used: Python


Requirements:
	- 2 terminals (must be directed to this folder)
	- Source Codes

How to compile:
	1) On the first terminal, type "py server.py"
	2) On the second terminal, type "py client.py"
	3) On the second terminal, type the message you want to convert to Pig Latin.
	4) On both terminals, the pig latin message should show up.
	5) If you still want to input another message to convert to pig latin, type "1", and see Step 4.
	6) When it disconnects, disconnect messages must be seen on both terminals. Type "py client.py" on the second terminal if you want to try the code again, and see Step 3.
	7) When done with testing code, close both terminals.


NOTE: See client.py, server.py, and piglatin.py for the DOCUMENTATION.


Restrictions:
	- The pig latin function can only accept strings
	- Words must have more than 1 letters
